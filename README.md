This is a simple text based game in which the player attempts to complete as
many laps as possible.

Has only been tested on linux ubuntu and requires ncurses to work.

Compile statement:
g++ main.cpp Player.cpp Player.h Enemy.cpp Enemy.h -o run -std=c++0x -lncurses -I.

Run statement:
For Unix systems:
  ./run
For Windows:
  run

Thank you!
